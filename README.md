## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

- Taking user input via `Scanner`
- Applying conditional logic (`if-else` statements)
- Understanding the rules of leap years
- Writing clean and readable Java code

## 📖 What is a Leap Year?

A **leap year** is a year with 366 days instead of 365.  
The extra day is added to February, making it 29 days long instead of 28.

### Rules for Determining a Leap Year:
1. The year must be divisible by 4
2. If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400
3. Otherwise, it's **not** a leap year

### Examples:
- ✅ 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
- ❌ 1900 is **not** a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400)
- ✅ 2024 is a leap year (divisible by 4 and not 100)

## 💻 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter a year
2. The program applies the leap year rules
3. Displays whether the year is a leap year or not
